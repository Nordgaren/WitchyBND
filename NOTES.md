* Added detection and usage of Oodle 28 (from Armored Core VI) to SoulsFormats and Witchy. (By Nordgaren)
* Updated Fxr3 class to the newest findings from Rainbow Stone development. (This is **breaking** for the serialization, so convert all the XMLs you need to FXR before updating.)
* Fixed an oversight that could cause issues with error printing to the console.
* Small fixes behind the scenes to make working with the project easier for contributors.
