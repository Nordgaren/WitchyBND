* New attempt at GPARAM support, using decompiled code from a random YabberAvocado zip. Appears to do a byte-perfect roundtrip unlike all other versions. Testing needed.
* Project cleanup for less warnings.
* Moved to NuGet versioning format (1.0.4.0 instead of 1.0.4).
* Properly display assembly info data.
